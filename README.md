# deforumation
A GUI to remotely steer the Deforum motions in real time.

## Dependencies
wxPython (pip install wxPython)
The version of deforum needs to be "Deforum extension for auto1111 webui, v2.3b"

##Introduction
As a big fan of deforum, I did this small "Hack" in order to remotely be able to change motion values while deforum is rendering.

##Getting started
In order for deforumation to work, the files "animation.py" and "render.py" need to be replaced with the ones provided in "deforum-for-automatic1111-webui\scripts\deforum_helpers"
Two files will be created in C:\Temp when the application is started, "prompt.txt" and "prompt.txt.locked", so be sure that you have a Temp folder on C:
These two files are used as the communication between Deforum and Deforumation.
